# Parametrized Pattern Matching

Search a PATTERN with one bijection or substitution allowed, meaning "axollot" will match "blessed" with a->b, x->l, o->e, l->s and t->d.

Currently implementing classic search algorithm (naive, KMP) to search for those match.

usage:

 * make
 * ./search PATTERN TEXT
